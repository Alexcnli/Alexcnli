**👋 Hi, I’m @Alexcnli**

I’m interested in **playing Boardgames** ♟️, watching movies 🍿, reading books 📚 (and any other nerdy things😛)

**Boardgame Recommedation:** _Brass: Birmingham_ if you want something strategic; and _Camel Up_ if you want to play casually

💻 I’m currently learning React.js and React native

Fun fact: I like to use 🖲️ more than 🖱️

📫 You can simply find me on my Instagram: _alexli0o_ & My Youtube Channel: _Meeple Match_ (Chinese & Cantonese only)
